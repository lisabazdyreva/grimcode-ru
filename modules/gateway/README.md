# gateway

Public entry, routing and external security. Gateway is the **only** container published outside;
every other service lives on the internal Docker network.

It has no database and contains no product business logic.

## Routing

The path is never rewritten — a service receives exactly the address the browser asked for.

| Incoming path | Target | Gateway check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/admin/embed/service/:name/**` | admin surface of that service | session, admin role, grant on `:name` |
| `/admin/**` | `admin` | session and an admin role |
| `/service/:name/**` | service from the public allowlist | none — the service secures itself |
| `/app/**` | `app` | none — App verifies the user session itself |
| everything else | `site` | none — public |

`:name` is never turned into a hostname. It is only ever looked up in the explicit allowlists in
[`src/registry.ts`](src/registry.ts):

- **public** — `auth`, `users`;
- **admin** — `auth`, `users`, `notifications`, `email`, `adminer`.

Adminer is deliberately absent from the public list. An unknown name has no entry, so nothing is
proxied and Admin is not even asked about it — the answer is 404.

`scripts/check-service-ids.mjs` reconciles these lists with `contracts/` and the central Admin
shell, so a service can never be reachable here while being invisible in the shell.

## Admin authorization

Every `/admin/**` request — HTML, API and assets alike — passes the same check. There is no
separate public policy for admin assets.

The whole check is one internal Admin method, `admin.authorize`. Gateway computes nothing itself,
keeps no copy of the rights and caches no result, which is why a changed grant takes effect on the
very next request.

| Admin answer | Gateway |
| --- | --- |
| `allowed` | proxies and forwards the verified administrator context |
| `denied` | 403, regardless of the reason |
| `awaiting-first-user` | 403 explaining that nobody has registered yet |
| unreachable | **503**, fail-closed — an outage is never reported as "no rights" |

### The administrator context is a trust boundary

Before deciding anything, Gateway deletes every `x-template-admin-*` and `x-template-request-id`
header from the incoming request — on **all** routes, including public ones. It writes them again
only from a verified `allowed` result. A browser can therefore never forge an administrator
context, and a service can trust the headers precisely because only Gateway can reach it.

## Responses and encoding

The proxy runtime decodes compressed responses transparently, so Gateway asks upstream for
`accept-encoding: identity` and removes `content-encoding` and `content-length` from what it
forwards — those headers would otherwise no longer describe the body. Hop-by-hop headers are
dropped in both directions.

Upstream redirects are passed through untouched (`redirect: 'manual'`), because a service's own
redirect belongs to the browser. Adminer's very first response is exactly that: a redirect that
also sets its own session cookie.

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PROJECT_SLUG` | Session cookie name Gateway reads to find the session token |
| `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | External origin, used in the sign-in link of the 403 page |
| `SERVICE_URL_*` | Optional overrides of internal service base URLs |

Gateway's own listening port is fixed inside the image. Locally the published host port comes from
`GATEWAY_PORT` in `.env`; in production nothing is published at all.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @template/gateway test
```
