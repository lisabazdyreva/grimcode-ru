# notifications

Accepts typed events from services and routes them to Email.

Notifications stores no email templates and never reads another service's database. It is a
routing layer with a memory, not a mail service.

## Closed set of events

Only the event types declared in `contracts/src/notifications.ts` are accepted. The contract is a
discriminated union, so an unknown type is rejected by validation before it can reach storage.

The template ships the base auth events needed for registration, email verification, account
recovery and email change:

| Event | Email template |
| --- | --- |
| `auth.user.registered` | `auth-welcome` |
| `auth.email.verification_requested` | `auth-verify-email` |
| `auth.password.reset_requested` | `auth-password-reset` |
| `auth.email.change_requested` | `auth-confirm-email-change` |
| `auth.email.changed` | `auth-email-changed` |

A product adds its own events by extending the contract and this map — not by accepting free-form
payloads.

## Protection against repeated processing

Every `emit` carries a caller-supplied `dedupeKey`. The unique index on `events.dedupe_key` is what
actually prevents a repeated delivery from being routed twice: the second call reports the stored
event and does nothing else. Email deduplicates on its own side as well, so even a retried routing
cannot send the same message twice.

## Failures stay visible

If Email cannot be reached, the event is kept with status `failed` and the error message. It shows
up in the service admin instead of disappearing into a log line.

## Surfaces

| Mount | Reachable as | Callers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/internal/rpc` | internal Docker network only | other services emitting events |
| `/admin/embed/service/notifications/rpc` | through Gateway's admin route | administrators granted Notifications |

Notifications has **no public surface**: it is deliberately absent from Gateway's public
allowlist, so no browser can emit an event.

## Data

Database `<PROJECT_SLUG>_notifications`, single `events` table. Migrations are in
[`src/db/migrations.ts`](src/db/migrations.ts).

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Base connection; Notifications uses `<PROJECT_SLUG>_notifications` |
| `PROJECT_SLUG` | Database naming |

## Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @template/notifications test
```
