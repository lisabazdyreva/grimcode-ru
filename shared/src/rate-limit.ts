/**
 * A fixed-window attempt counter.
 *
 * Deliberately in memory and deliberately small. It exists so that guessing one account's password
 * is not free, which is a per-service concern and belongs next to the check it protects. Volumetric
 * limits — requests per address, per network — belong at the edge proxy in front of Gateway, which
 * is the only thing that knows the real client address; see `docs/deployment.md`.
 *
 * Counting in memory means each instance counts on its own, so running two copies doubles the
 * allowance. That is exact for the topology this template ships — one process, and every module
 * inside it shares that process — and a deliberate trade against writing a row on every failed
 * attempt. It stops being exact the moment there is more than one instance of the server.
