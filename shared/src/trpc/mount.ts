/**
 * Mounts a tRPC router on an exact path prefix.
 *
 * Each module keeps its surfaces on separate mounts, so the trust boundary is visible in the routing
 * table itself: `/service/<name>/rpc` is public, `/admin/embed/service/<name>/rpc` needs the admin
 * grant, and Gateway routes nothing at all to `/internal/rpc`.
 *
 * **`resHeaders` is merged by hand, and that is a choice rather than a necessity.** The fetch adapter
 * keeps a `Headers` of its own, hands it to `createContext` beside `req` and returns it as the
 * response headers — taking it from there instead would make the merge below unnecessary. This mount
 * carries its own object so that what a procedure receives is decided here and not by the adapter's
 * option shape. Either way the merge is load-bearing while it exists: removed, signing in stops
 * setting the session cookie, and the acceptance suite fails on its first call with a 403.
 *
 * **`allowMethodOverride` lets a query arrive as POST.** Without it a query sent by POST answers
 * 405, and staying on POST keeps request bodies out of URLs — off the length limit, and out of the
 * caches a GET invites, since tRPC sets no `Cache-Control` of its own.
